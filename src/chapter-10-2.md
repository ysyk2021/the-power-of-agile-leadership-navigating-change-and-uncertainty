Agile leaders must also ensure that their teams are aware of the organization's ethical principles and values and are operating in accordance with them.

Transparency and Accountability

Transparency and accountability are critical components of agile leadership. Agile leaders must ensure that their teams are transparent about their decision-making processes and are held accountable for their actions. This includes ensuring that ethical considerations are taken into account when making decisions.
